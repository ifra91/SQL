DBMS and its types
==================

Database Mangement System is a data keeping software that allows to store data on servers
which can be managed and retrieved easily. Data is basic building block of every organization
for example it makes easier for an organization to keep its employee and student recorded stored 
in such a manner so they can be retireved easily. 

Collection of Data, that serves multiple application, 
it is stored in separate physical sysytems independent 
of the applications/progeam that use them.

Database is collection of inter-related information

=======================
Database Implementation
=======================
The main purpose of data is to be used by end user, the database which uses data structure
which provides ease to end user.
Implementation is done through three levels where 

First Level -> Internal level, physical level which concerns with the storage medium and platform 
on which data is stored and what data structures are used to store data.

Second Level -> Conceptual level, it describes the relation among data, and what data it represents.
The user at this level is not concerned with the logic of data structure used at physical level.

Third Level -> External level(view level), the user can view only information from data which is relevant to them.
this level extracts the simplified â€Œinformation for the user.

Types of Data Management Systems
================================
Relational DBMS
Hierarchical DBMS
Network DBMS
Object-Oriented DBMS
NoSQL
Cloud Database
Centralized
De-centralized/Distributed Database

Database model is the information which is required to create a database,
what type of data will be used
